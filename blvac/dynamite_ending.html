            <P class="trip">The next day we had decided to take a trip to Preston, Idaho to see Napoleon Dynamite’s town and school. We were only an hour away. It was another pretty drive with nature, rivers, and trees. When we had a signal to listen to music, we played the Napoleon soundtrack. I’m glad my wife liked that movie like me. The tour was Napoleon’s high school, Pedro’s house, grandma’s house, the Deseret Industries, and Summer’s house. We were surprised and happy to see a sign in front of Napoleon’s grandma’s house saying we could take a picture. On our way out we stopped for some Hawaiian food. When we entered, we realized we were at the bowling alley Uncle Rico played at! What a way to end our trip. Until next time Idaho!</P>
