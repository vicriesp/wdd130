        My wife and I had to cancel our trip to Los Angeles. Instead, we went to Bear Lake! We live so close, but had never visited. We wanted to go to the beach and the lake was the closest thing to us. We packed up and drove for a few hours. The road was up through a canyon and there were a lot of trees. We were looking forward to getting to the lake. We were surprised that this place so close to Provo existed. Finally, we drove down the canyon and got the view of the lake. The water was turquoise and extended to both sides as far as we could see. We couldn’t believe our eyes. We couldn’t wait to be up close to the lake to touch the water. We drove towards Idaho because we heard the north side of the lake was the prettiest. We got into town and it was a little tourist town with boats everywhere. We didn’t stop because we wanted to get to the water. With our turkey sandwiches in our cooler, we finally arrived! We drove on the sand and it's a good thing we didn’t get stuck. It was like we were on a beach in Baja California, but in Utah. We set up our spot with our beach umbrella and got in the water. It was amazing to feel the sand below our feet even if we felt like we were sinking in. It was relaxing to be away from work! We didn’t want to leave, but we would be back the next day.

      <h3>Unexpected Weather</h3>
      <p>
        We arrived to North Beach again with our lunch and our fruit in our cooler. We set up our spot. It was a little cloudy, but we didn’t think much of it. We listened to music and danced. It was great to be on vacation. We got in the water, ate, and got in the water again. We noticed it was getting a little grayer in the sky. My wife felt some sprinkles coming from the sky. She said she would go to the car just in case it rained. She got some important things like the speaker and went to the car. All of a sudden it started to rain a little more. I went to the car to wait for the storm to pass. When my wife checked the weather app, it said there was a storm warning! It warned of thunder and lightning and said we needed to be away from the water! We then saw that the winds were strong and the sand was blowing everywhere. Our cooler and our beach gear were still outside. I almost got out of the car to get it, but the lighting kept coming. The weather app said if you are close enough to hear thunder you are close enough to be hit by lightning! No way! We saw people trying to take their beach tents down in the sandstorm. Many items were blowing away. Since the storm wasn’t stopping, we decided to leave our beach stuff there including our fruit dessert! We drove back to our Airbnb grateful we were safe and determined to go back next summer.

      <h3>Dynamite Ending</h3>
      <p>
        The next day we had decided to take a trip to Preston, Idaho to see Napoleon Dynamite’s town and school. We were only an hour away. It was another pretty drive with nature, rivers, and trees. When we had a signal to listen to music, we played the Napoleon soundtrack. I’m glad my wife liked that movie like me. The tour was Napoleon’s high school, Pedro’s house, grandma’s house, the Deseret Industries, and Summer’s house. We were surprised and happy to see a sign in front of Napoleon’s grandma’s house saying we could take a picture. On our way out we stopped for some Hawaiian food. When we entered, we realized we were at the bowling alley Uncle Rico played at! What a way to end our trip. Until next time Idaho!
