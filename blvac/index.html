        <P class="getting-to-bearlake">My wife and I had to cancel our trip to Los Angeles. Instead, we went to Bear Lake! We live so close, but had never visited. We wanted to go to the beach and the lake was the closest thing to us. We packed up and drove for a few hours. The road was up through a canyon and there were a lot of trees. We were looking forward to getting to the lake. We were surprised that this place so close to Provo existed. Finally, we drove down the canyon and got the view of the lake. The water was turquoise and extended to both sides as far as we could see. We couldn’t believe our eyes. We couldn’t wait to be up close to the lake to touch the water. We drove towards Idaho because we heard the north side of the lake was the prettiest. </P>

        <p class="continue">We got into town and it was a little tourist town with boats everywhere. We didn’t stop because we wanted to get to the water. With our turkey sandwiches in our cooler, we finally arrived! We drove on the sand and it's a good thing we didn’t get stuck. It was like we were on a beach in Baja California, but in Utah. We set up our spot with our beach umbrella and got in the water. It was amazing to feel the sand below our feet even if we felt like we were sinking in. It was relaxing to be away from work! We didn’t want to leave, but we would be back the next day.</p>
