            <P>We arrived to North Beach again with our lunch and our fruit in our cooler. We set up our spot. It was a little cloudy, but we didn’t think much of it. We listened to music and danced. It was great to be on vacation. We got in the water, ate, and got in the water again. We noticed it was getting a little grayer in the sky. My wife felt some sprinkles coming from the sky. She said she would go to the car just in case it rained. She got some important things like the speaker and went to the car. All of a sudden it started to rain a little more. I went to the car to wait for the storm to pass.</P>

            <p>When my wife checked the weather app, it said there was a storm warning! It warned of thunder and lightning and said we needed to be away from the water! We then saw that the winds were strong and the sand was blowing everywhere. Our cooler and our beach gear were still outside. I almost got out of the car to get it, but the lighting kept coming. The weather app said if you are close enough to hear thunder you are close enough to be hit by lightning! No way! We saw people trying to take their beach tents down in the sandstorm. Many items were blowing away. Since the storm wasn’t stopping, we decided to leave our beach stuff there including our fruit dessert! We drove back to our Airbnb grateful we were safe and determined to go back next summer.</p>
